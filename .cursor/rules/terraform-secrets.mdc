# Secrets Vault Integration

## Secret Management

1. **Storage:**
   - Store secrets in your cloud secrets vault, not in Terraform state
   - Reference secrets by name in container service environment variables
   - Mount secrets as volume files for larger secrets or when files are needed
   - Use secret versions (e.g., `latest`) in container service config

2. **Best Practices:**
   - Never put secret values in `.tf` files or `.tfvars` files
   - Use cloud CLI or Terraform resources for secret creation
   - Rotate secrets by creating new versions, not modifying existing secrets

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working with secrets:

- "Don't hardcode secrets in Terraform files"
- "Use secrets vault for sensitive values"
- "Store secrets in secrets vault, not in Terraform state"
- "Mount secrets as volume files, not environment variables for sensitive data"
